      "Jarvis: Converting degrees to radians involves the use of a simple conversion factor. The equivalence is that 180 degrees equals π radians. So, to convert 220 degrees to radians, you can set up the following equation:\n",
      "\n",
      "220 degrees * (π radians / 180 degrees) = θ radians\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's calculate that. The degrees cancel out, leaving us with just radians:\n",
      "\n",
      "220 * π / 180 = approximately 3.8397 radians\n",
      "\n",
      "So, 220 degrees is equivalent to approximately 3.8397 radians. Remember, π is roughly 3.14159, so the actual value of θ will depend on the exact value you use for π.\n",
